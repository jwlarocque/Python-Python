# Python-Python
Snake for terminal, in Python.
Score points (displayed in the upper left) by collecting exclamation marks ('!').  If the snake touches itself or, in BOUND mode, the walls, the game is over.
Point values, snake speed, and framerate can be adjusted in the source file.


Controls:
*   Arrow keys - start the game and control the snake's direction
*   W - starting screen only, toggle wrap mode (after hitting a wall, the snake will emerge from the other side of the screen instead of dying)
*   P - pause the game
*   Q - end the game, and on the game over screen - quit the game
*   R - game over screen only, restart to the starting screen
